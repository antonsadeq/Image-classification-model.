# Image-classification-model.
A trained CNN model on over 12000 images from 20 different classes.
A model that has been trained on a huge amount of data, and the task was to classify 20 different classes of images with an accuracy of over 50%, Through the journey of building the models, I got to discover and learn new techniques that can help me in this task, such as:
Data preprocessing: How can I handle such big data with over 12000 images?
Tunning Model's hyperparameters: How can I tune the hyperparameters and discover what affects the model's performance and accuracy?
Handling images' data: Dealing with Images, enables me to use the data augmentation techniques to improve the model's performance.
